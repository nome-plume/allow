There is a piece of you that exists outside of your normal concious self. Let's call this piece your inner being. 
It could be called soul. It could be called a piece of God, all that is, expressing through you. 
  
There is a piece of you who collects all of your desires, and is constantly asking for them. It draws energy through you, like a wound asks for healing, 
it is asking for completion. It demands a response. 
This piece communicates to you through emotion. If you feel good, you are fulfilling your inner being. 
The art of allowing. 
As desires, decisions, and preferences build up, your inner being is constantly asking for fulfillment of them. As we grow older, these 
build up and up. Unless they are fulfilled, it will wear you down. 
This is why old people are cranky, and deteriorate. 
  
When you injure yourself, you can feel the asking of the body for energy. There is an asking, allowing process. The inner being is asking all the time.
This needs to be allowed.  
  
On things that are important to you, break but never bend. In other words, you pick that hill and will die on that hill if need be. If people don't agree, 
let them come at you. They will lose. Having this attitude will take you far.
