## There is another part of you, always asking
There is a piece of you that exists outside of your normal concious self. Let's call this piece your inner being. 
It could be called soul. It could be called a piece of God, all that is, expressing through you. 
  
_#TODO clean up_

There is a piece of you who collects all of your desires, and is constantly asking for them. It draws energy through you, like a wound asks for healing, 
it is asking for completion. It demands a response. 
This piece communicates to you through emotion. If you feel good, you are fulfilling your inner being. 
The art of allowing. 
As desires, decisions, and preferences build up, your inner being is constantly asking for fulfillment of them. As we grow older, these 
build up and up. Unless they are fulfilled, it will wear you down. 
This is why old people are cranky, and deteriorate. 

## Asking and Allowing  
Feel the asking when you hurt yourself. Feel the pain and the response.  
Feel the asking when you work out. The muscles asking for completion.  
Pain demands a response. There are two parts to creation - the asking, and the allowing of the response.  

Two parts to it - the asking. The asking can be painful, can be uncomfortable, but it is important.  
The second part is allowing. Turn to the asking and be a conduit for the response. Focus on what is needed.  
  
A good attitude to have is - I will break but never bend on this. If people don't agree, come take it from me.  
An ask - a challenge - an allow, no matter what. Meditate on this.
