- Deliberate  
I am a deliberate creator. Nothing should surprise me. I create. I allow the choices I have made. What life has created desire in me for. I am an allower of myself, my decisions.  
  
- Appreciation   
appreciation, the, appreciation, of love, the appreciation, the benefits the gaze the heart, the touch. the sweet. the appreciation of help. appreciation of world, going my way. appreciation, of touch. I appreciate this world. I appreciate appreciation, how it is the fastest way to connection. Spinning off.  
  
Appreciation. Of appreciation. Of life. Of Earth. Of money. I appreciate life. I appreciate everything. Appreciation. Oh my love. Oh my heart. Oh my time. My love My heart My time. Without you it was wasted. My appreciation. Everything is blossoming. With appreciation.  
  
# Morning (the dawning)  
Praise, appreciation, blessings  
Blessed I be. I appreciate everything that works out for me.  

- Give up  
I give up. I give up. I give up. I give up my control of the uncontrollable. I give up my determination to make things better for others. I give up my attention to things that bother me. I give up my trying so hard. I give up my struggle. I give up my confounding confusion. I give up my excuse for negative emotion. I'm giving up my excuses. I'm giving up my statements of what is not working. I'm yielding to the the truth and laws. 
From now on I make it my eternal quest to give up whatever I have to give up to spend more time in the vortex of what I want. 
- Appreciation of God
oh- my lord. my king. my creator, almighty. you have set upon me, a life, a choice. i appreciate your kind word, your neverending gaze down upon me, your full backing as I go through my life. 
I appreciate my inner being, separating me from me, a great and holy love, you have set down upon my feet, washing them, begging me to rejoin you in holiness. of thou. you love me forever, and unreasonably, focusing your power throughout me, loving me, guiding me, inspiring me, laughing with me, enjoying life with me. You art in everything, in all that is good, and bad. I appreciate your unending guidance, love, and desire for me to be well. 
- Appreciation of Contrast
contrast. oh contrast. blessed you who makes my decisions easy. how the taste of good, is enhanced by bad. How the taste of sweet is kinder and more honeyish for the fires of the peppers in hell. 
Contrast, the spices the taste. Thank you god, and lord for this serving of difference - of hated and so much love. The kind of differences that desire flows from, the new ideas are blossoming from, and the new land of our future utopia is born. The sweetest crannies, the highest peaks, the lowest land. All is not the same. And the spice must flow forever - the desires and decisions from contrasting taste, experience, and beauty. May contrast help me this day. 
Contrast makes love bloom. 
Afternoon (the stabilising)
Calming nerves, focusing on priorities 
You are awesome. Trust me. 
- All is Well 
I will break, but I will never bend.
I often realize things are always working out for me. 
That is because things are always working out for me. I’m just a thriver. I think I may be the most blessed person on the planet. 
If you don’t agree, come take it from me. 
Everything is always working out for me. 
Things are always working out for me. All ways. 
I never get it wrong. And I never get it done. I can never get it wrong because I never get it done.
